# Project: **Social Isolation Prediction**

## üìò Introduction

The development of the framework consists of 3 parts: RADARBASE which can be found at the following link: https://github.com/ecariel/RADAR-kubernetes, the prediction of social isolation present in this repository and the visualization which is done using Elasticsearch and Kibana.

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Automation:** Simplify the deployment and management of RADAR-base using Kubernetes.
2. **Scalability:** Ensure services can scale horizontally and vertically based on system demands.
3. **Security:** Implement and manage secrets and credentials in a centralized manner.
4. **Modularity:** Allow services to be easily interchangeable or configurable.
5. **Monitoring and analysis:** Integrate tools like Elasticsearch and Kibana for real-time data monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Use monitoring predictions

   ```shell
   cd modelos-image/
   docker build -t tu-usuario/modelos-image:latest .
   docker push tu-usuario/modelos-image:latest
   cd ..
   ```
